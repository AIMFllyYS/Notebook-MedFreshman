# StudySolo / Classolo integration specification

Date: 2026-09-27. Status: stage approved for commit; local build/tests passed; production not deployed; release acceptance pending.

## Target

Replace StudySolo `/class` placeholder with the existing Classolo transcript capture, note organizer, mindmap, render-module and classroom-chat capabilities inside the host shell. Preserve original Classolo working tree; copied code is namespaced under this repository and recorded with provenance. Heavy graph/render modules load only with Class mode, following vercel-react-best-practices.

## Boundaries

- Account remains the login/registration/recovery UI. Same-root deployments consume shared HttpOnly sessions; the retained external domain uses the official Supabase OAuth server with PKCE and its own host-only cookie transport. StudySolo validates issuer/user/email/MFA server-side. No independent old Supabase login fallback, custom token issuer or JavaScript cookie writer.
- Cloud classroom tables use ss_class_* and auth.users UUID ownership. Sessions own transcript/note/render/chat records via composite owner/session foreign keys. RLS denies other users, including cross-session writes.
- Original anonymous PGlite tenancy is not carried over. Repository interface is adapted to authenticated StudySolo APIs; offline cache and pending writes use the verified user UUID and are never replayed under a different account.
- Platform API/ASR/search keys stay server-side. Existing capture/resampling is reused; cloud ASR transport processes bounded audio chunks through authenticated server endpoints. UI labels chunk-based ASR as near-real-time, not true streaming.
- AI uses the central ecosystem credit reservation/settlement/cancellation RPC with idempotency. Never give the browser service credentials or let a request choose arbitrary upstream URLs. Unknown upstream outcomes remain reserved for reconciliation.
- Generic StudySolo business names become ss_* where project-specific. Identity, member rights and credit authority come from shared user_profiles/membership/credit APIs; old local grants are historical, not a second authoritative quota pool.
- Class outputs integrate with existing StudySolo notes/assets and shared asset_index. Source classroom records retain provenance. No file or source-data deletion.

## Implementation phases

1. Canonical Account session bridge and Supabase server verification; shared quota adapters.
2. Copy/adapt classroom feature modules and typed repository boundary; cloud schema and local owner-isolated pending persistence.
3. Recording/ASR, notes/mindmap, render modules and chat tool loops through authenticated billed server endpoints.
4. Session library/resume, persistence of all classroom outputs, asset export/index integration and host layout.
5. Unit/integration tests, schema RLS tests in an explicitly approved local fixture, typecheck/build, UI validation. Parent subsequently authorized backing up and configuring local/production environment files; provider administration and remote SQL remain coordinated by the parent.

## Acceptance evidence

Require real capture path and bounded ASR transport, actual AI model API path, save/reopen session, transcripts/notes/render/chat persistence, account-switch isolation, RLS cross-owner denial, quota admission failure preventing upstream calls, retry/settlement idempotency and host navigation. Local mocks prove contracts only; live provider and production acceptance remain explicit external gates.

## Retained-domain OAuth deployment contract

Production remains `https://notebook1b.husteread.icu`; local development is `http://localhost:35349`. Each is a separately registered public PKCE client with exact callback `/api/account/oauth/callback`. Configure `SUPABASE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`, `APP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, RootSolo `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` / publishable anon key and server-only service key. A client secret is unnecessary for these public clients. Do not put service/provider keys in `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables.

- `/api/account/oauth/start`: state and S256 PKCE, bounded local return path; only registered official authorize/token endpoints.
- `/api/account/oauth/callback`: exact state and code exchange; validates canonical identity and registered client. Incomplete required MFA becomes a pending local session, not an application login.
- `POST /api/account/session`, `/refresh`, `/logout` consistently use host-only **ss_access_token / ss_refresh_token / ss_remember_me** when the OAuth client is configured. They never fall back to Account's `access_token` / `refresh_token`. This also prevents collisions with Account on another localhost port. Explicit authenticated API Bearer calls remain supported.
- Pending MFA uses **ss_mfa_access_token / ss_mfa_refresh_token / ss_mfa_next**, HttpOnly, path `/api/account`, maximum 15 minutes. Pending sessions cannot authorize classroom or other protected business APIs. `/auth/challenge` loads owned verified TOTP factors through `/api/account/mfa` and submits challenge/verify with exact Origin checking.
- Supabase currently emits a fresh aal1 OAuth session even after aal2 Account consent. Official MFA verification produces aal2 without `client_id`; the BFF immediately performs official OAuth refresh and validates matching user, session_id, registered client_id and aal2 before writing formal cookies. The intermediate token is never an application session. Required MFA means enrolled factors or server-owned admin/super_admin role; ordinary users without MFA need not enroll to log in.
- Logout revokes this OAuth session using local scope and clears only StudySolo's own cookies; Account shared login remains intact. Same-root deployment without an OAuth client uses the Account bridge instead.

`.env.local` overrides `.env.production` in an ordinary Next build. Production builds must inject parsed `.env.production` variables into the child process environment before starting Next. Passing Node `--env-file` directly to Next fails its worker launch on the current toolchain; use a parent Node process with `util.parseEnv` and `spawnSync`, not that flag. Never print the parsed values. Environment backups are in the protected migration backup directory, outside Git.

## Storage, preservation and service configuration

Apply migrations `202609270001_classroom_cloud.sql`, `202609270002_studysolo_content.sql`, and billing companion `202609270003_usage_detail.sql` after the shared foundation and current central RPC migrations. No historical SQL was rewritten. Authenticated users have owner-filtered read access; business writes use verified server endpoints and central storage accounting in the same SQL transaction. Composite session/owner foreign keys prevent child records being attached to another user's classroom. Inactive users and incomplete required MFA cannot read classroom content via RLS.

Class cache keys are `ss-class:v1:<canonical UUID>`; host IndexedDB/localStorage keys are `ss-user:<canonical UUID>:<logical key>`. Original unscoped `gailvlun-db` / `keyval` content and old localStorage values remain where they were. They are intentionally not auto-assigned to the next signed-in user. Recovery requires identifying the original browser profile and legitimate account before explicit owner-scoped import. Original standalone Classolo/PGlite data and dirty source remain untouched.

Transcript and derived notes, renders and chat synchronize to the cloud; raw WAV chunks remain in that user's local IndexedDB and are exportable as a ZIP. Unsynchronized writes retain stable operation keys, and account switching aborts old-owner activity. Local storage capacity errors surface visibly and prevent silent overwrite; do not delete or prune user files to recover space.

Classroom text AI uses existing server model/provider configuration and known positive pricing. ASR additionally requires `CLASS_ASR_BASE_URL`, `CLASS_ASR_API_KEY`, `CLASS_ASR_MODEL`, `CLASS_ASR_CNY_PER_SECOND`; image search requires `CLASS_IMAGE_SEARCH_API_KEY` and `CLASS_IMAGE_SEARCH_CNY_PER_CALL`. Missing service or pricing configuration disables the capability/fails closed. Unknown upstream outcomes remain held for reconciliation, not automatically refunded and retried. See the companion central billing document for existing StudySolo AI routes.

## Verification record (in progress)

- TypeScript passed after the auth/Class/storage integration; full ESLint had 0 errors (19 warnings, including existing React Compiler/TanStack compatibility warnings).
- Local retained PostgreSQL database `rootsolo_studysolo_class_fixture_20260927`: classroom owner isolation, required MFA, server-only writes, cross-owner composite FK rejection, central storage accounting and quota failure rollback passed. Synthetic tests roll back their rows; the source template is unchanged.
- 44 existing local storage/lifecycle/navigation tests pass with owner-scoped fixtures; 2 sync adapter tests verify canonical reads and BFF writes. 19 auth/UI regression tests pass, including fixing stale initial session results overwriting a newer login.
- Full React suite: 182 files / 793 tests pass with four workers. 14 PKCE/cookie isolation tests, 5 local MFA lineage tests and 9 Class provider admission tests are included. A real SDK in-memory session test verifies authenticated quota/Agent transport without JavaScript cookie writes. An additional 9 canonical server auth tests pass, covering missing/inactive profiles, unconfirmed email, wrong issuer, metadata role distrust and required MFA.
- Browser verified signed-out Class mode inside the host shell. Authenticated cloud/classroom, actual microphone/ASR, real model billing and production-browser acceptance remain pending. Mock tests do not claim those paths have passed.
- Static prebuild checks pass: UTF-8, lecture/navigation registry, script ids, KaTeX, recording escapes, media links and SVG rules (94 existing registry warnings, no errors). Full code unit suite after test-only canonical auth/admission fixture migration: 1714 tests, 1713 pass, 0 fail, 1 existing opt-in PostgreSQL skip; real database tests were run separately. Logs remain in ignored `.local-archive`.
- Production environment Next 16.2.9 build passed, including TypeScript and 1406 generated routes/pages. Existing content KaTeX metrics and dynamic filesystem trace warnings remain; they did not fail the build. Dev service subsequently restored on 35349.
- Tracked and newly added files passed credential pattern scans. 318 production browser JavaScript assets were checked against 14 configured private provider/service credentials: no matches. Supabase's publishable anon key is intentionally included in the browser.
- Parent review tightened migrations to require an active profile and confirmed/nondeleted canonical user, removed service DELETE/TRUNCATE, made storage-reference rows service-read-only, and applied them to RootSolo. Parent's fresh all-migration fixture `studysolo_review_20260927092936` passed `tests/sql/canonical-read-gates.sql`; real API acceptance is being conducted separately.
- Latest live acceptance attempt: RootSolo REST connections from this machine failed with TLS `ECONNRESET`, including system curl; management API remained reachable. The real classroom API script failed while reading storage before any classroom mutation: **0 classroom writes**. This does not establish successful business acceptance. MainECS SSH connections were also being closed at this point. Keep the local 35349 development service running for retest when connectivity recovers.
- ASR remains unconfigured. Real browser OAuth consent/denial, local TOTP completion, authenticated classroom save/reopen and real provider billing remain explicit pending release gates; successful compilation or mock tests do not substitute for them.
